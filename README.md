#### Welcome to the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree capstone project II - a Disaster Response Pipeline.<br>
- This excercise is meant as a practice of writing machine learning pipelines - with focus on ETL, model training and deployment in a web-app.<br>
- The core idea behind this project is to create a pipeline able to automatically identify disasters based on text messages around the social media using a machine learning classifier.<br>
